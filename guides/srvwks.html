<p>It might seem stupid to use Windows Server for workstation use,
but in my opinion there are good uses for it, such include:<br></p>

1. Performance<br>
2. Less bloated<br>
3. You can use any server features when they will be needed<br>
If this was enough for you to try to do so. I can help you with it using this page right here<br>

<p><h2>Notes</h2><br>
1. If you are using a Wi-Fi card, you need to enable <b>Wireless LAN Service</b> for your Wi-Fi card to work<br>
2. Instructions might differ depending on which version of Windows Server you are using,
these differences will be noted in the article so you shouldn't worry about those differences<br>
3. In Windows Server 2008, Microsoft added Core SKU. It lacks explorer.exe and similar features,
if you came to Windows Server to have such features, you should pick non-core SKU</p>

<p><h2>Installation</h2><br>

Installation should be very easy. Since there are no differences between Client Windows installer and Server Windows installer.
Most parts of OOBE are skipped though. In Windows Server it's usually only password and nothing else</p>

<p><h2>Themes</h2><br>
<b>This step is not needed for Windows Server 2016 or newer</b><br>

After installation and logging in to the desktop, you might have noticed that theme is
either <b>Classic Theme</b> or <b>Aero Lite Theme</b>, there are a lot of people who like
those themes. But it's not for everyone so you might like to get default Client Windows
theme<br>

<h3>Step 1. Enable Themes service<br></h3>

To enable Themes service you need to open <b>Run</b> prompt and type <b>services.msc</b>,
after that you will see a window open, in it you have to find a service called <b>Themes</b>
(it might be translated to your native language if you haven't chosen English). After
finding it, you have to change from service being disabled to start automatically, and
then start the service. Now if you are using Windows Server 2003 you can go to Themes
or Appearance and change it to Luna theme. However if you are using newer versions,
you have to continue with this guide<br>

<h3>Step 2. Enable Desktop Experience <b>(not needed for Windows Server 2003)</b></h3><br>

Do you remember <b>Server Manager</b> that opened before. Well here it comes for
our needs. First, click on <b>Add Features</b> 
(Note: in Windows Server 2012 it's called Add Features and Roles, after it asks for
role to add, you just press Next without choosing anything), after doing it. You choose 
<b>Desktop Experience</b>, agree with adding anything that it asks for. After this you press
next, after your computer restarts you can use Aero or Aero Basic theme, currently while
it's installing, we can continue with next sections of this guide</p>

<p><h2>Disabling requirement for CTRL-ALT-DEL and password restrictions</h2><br>

You might have noticed that Windows Server requires pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL to logon,
plus password requirements are pretty strict,
this might not be what you like, and thankfully it can be disabled. To disable it.
First open Control Panel, then Administrative Tools, and double click on 
<b>Local Security Policy</b>. next, go to Local policies, then Security options,
then after looking through everything inside it, you will find Do not require
CTRL-ALT-DEL option. You have to enable this option, continuing with this program.
We go back and find user account policies, then inside it we find password policy,
and right there you can remove password restrictions and make password never expire.</p>

<p><h2>Disabling Shutdown Event Tracker</h2><br>

If you had to shutdown or restart already, you have noticed that unlike normal Windows, you have to
specify a reason to shutdown or restart. This can be explained for servers, but for
clients this is pretty annoying. To fix this we run <b>Run</b> prompt again, but now
instead of <b>services.msc</b>, we type <b>gpedit.msc</b>. Then we go to Computer
configuration - Administrative templates - System, then there we find Display
Shutdown Event Tracker, we change the option from <b>Not configured</b>, to <b>Disabled</b></p>

<p><h2>Performance and DEP</h2><br>

Now in <b>Performance</b> tab, for getting the most client Windows look I recommend
you to change Performance settings to ones for best appearance. In advanced, we
change optimizations from Background applications to Programs, after that we go to 3rd
section which should be DEP. In there we change from DEP being used everywhere to
only for default Windows programs. This will require a restart, if you completed
everything needed before this, you can restart</p>

<p><h2>Disabling IE ESC</h2><br>

We are pretty much done with this guide. However, if you tried to use Internet Explorer, 
likely to download a better browser))), a thing called Internet Explorer Enhanced Security 
is basically being a pain. To disable it, you go to <b>Server Manager</b> and find IE ESC 
and change from being on for administrators and users, to off for administrators and users</p>

The method I wrote above this image only works on Server 2008 or later, this images shows a way to do it on Server 2003 (R2)<br>

<p>I think this is enough for a guide, I might add new steps later if I think they would be
needed</p>
