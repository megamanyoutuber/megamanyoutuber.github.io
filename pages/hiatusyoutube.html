    <h1>Video series on a hiatus</h1>

    <p>If you are on my Discord server you may know already that I have put my video series on a hiatus. I have decided to undergo through this decision for various reasons that
    have been there for pretty much as long as the series was alive in one way or another. This post has been made as a follow up for my announcement on my Discord server
    so I would kindly ask everyone reading to read the announcement before reading this if you haven't already.</p>
    
    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>I have decided to put this video series on a hiatus after a long process of not being able to work on it at all due to my mental health that was decreasing,
    partially because I was not able to work on the series due to my lack of energy which basically put me in a loop that I could not get away from
    without ending this video series at least temporarily. Another problem with the series was that I was... honestly... too ambitious with it, especially for my skills at editing, drawing and etc.
    I was just asking too much for myself than I could realistically do, so I decided to put this series on a hiatus until a later time when I will likely have enough skills and energy
    to actually complete it.</p>
    
    <h2>What will happen to the YouTube channel?</h2>
    <p>Nothing, don't worry! I am planning to keep the channel up and running, as it is my own personal channel too, the videos won't dissapear either.</p>
    <p>There will be new videos too, however they won't be anything related to the video series that I was working on, just unrelated works of mine that I'll make out of boredom.
    Probably won't have any characters that were going to appear in this video series either, though I am not sure so you may see some cameos :)</p>
    
    <h2>What will happen to the Discord server?</h2>
    <p>Nothing either! The server is not connected to the video series or my channel at all, it's just a server that I made for various stuff I like and stuff like that, so it won't die
    either and will be alive as long as I want to use it.</p>
    
    <h2>What will you do after this video series?</h2>
    <p>I'm very likely going to be studying so I could find a job from which I could sustain myself at least a bit. I may also work on some unrelated projects that may or may not be on my
    YouTube channel, so it may still be useful to stay tuned and check out this website and my Discord server once in a while, maybe you'll find something that I'm working that you may
    enjoy!</p>
    
    <h2>Will this website be much more updated than before?</h2>
    <p>Maybe. I'll probably try making much more stuff on this website than before (hopefully not just website redesigns hehe), so that could be fun for me and y'all. I will be making stuff
    of all kind from typical tech stuff to my own personal stuff that I don't feel shy to talk about.</p>
    
    <h2>Do you feel better now than before?</h2>
    <p>Yeah I sure do, it feels liberating to actually not have such a hurdle on my head and have the possibility to concentrate on other things that are not just these stupid videos.
    I have been improving mentally in general, and I feel much easier than before. I still suffer through various issues but it's much easier than it was before and I don't feel like
    screaming and crying non-stop.</p>
