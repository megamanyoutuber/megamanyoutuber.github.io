        <p>Windows 8.1... It is hated by some, loved by some. To me, it is the best operating system
            that was ever made by Microsoft (Linux is still better :D).</p>
         
            <p>A lot of people ask, why would I love such a "terrible" operating system? The start screen
            is so unusual, the interface is flat, and it has full screen apps. I have heard that a lot
            before. But to me, go ahead, tell as much negative things about Windows 8.1, they are not true
            or not problematic to me.</p>
         
            <p>Start screen is honestly, beautiful. It really stands out to me. A lot of people say that
            it is unusual, and it takes up the whole screen. However I have found it to be comfortable to
            use, and I do not look at the desktop when I use start menu. Honestly, it is one of the most
            comfortable menus that I have seen in any operating system. After using Linux for so long,
            it is really annoying to find a menu that is good to me. I have only liked GNOME's menu,
            it is really nice.</p>

            <p>The interface is also beautiful to me. I am not a fan of flat interface, but Windows
            8.1... Oh my god, it just stands out to other flat interfaces. The person who created Metro
            is just a genius to me, especially after looking at Mica and Acrylic. It is just beautiful.
            The mix of flatness and skeuomorphism in Windows 8.1, is just beautiful. I really wish
            that they kept using the design.</p>

            <p>But Windows 8.1 is not only good because of interface. Under the hood it is also better
            than Windows 7 and 10. Windows 8.1 supports newer USB 3.x controllers out of the box,
            therefore I don't have to modify my Windows 8.1 ISO to work on my laptop, and many other
            newer devices.</p>
         
            <p>Windows 8.1 also supports Class 3 UEFI, which means it can boot on devices which don't
            support Compatibility Support Module. UefiSeven does exist, but it does not work for
            everybody and it's still a pain in the ass compared to Windows 8.1.</p>
         
            <p>Speed is also so good in Windows 8.1, in some cases it feels faster than Windosw 7 does
            on the same hardware. Even on a really customized version of Windows 8.1 that I am using.</p>
         
            <p>And if you are still mad at the start screen or the interface, just use Open-Shell and a
            custom theme like I do on Windows 8.1, because this theme is just so good. ;)</p>
