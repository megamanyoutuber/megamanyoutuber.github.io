        <p>If you know me quite a bit, you may know that I have a YouTube channel. I upload videos there, mainly
          about older tech stuff nowadays. If you have checked my channel well enough, you may have noticed that I
          seemingly don't upload a lot of videos. Why is that?</p>

        <p>Well... If I'll be honest, I have no idea why myself. I want to make videos, however I cannot get myself
          to do it. This is the main problem with my videos, is that I have non-ending procrastination when making them.
          I want to make them, however I cannot get myself to actually make them. It's so annoying as you can realize.
          I have no idea how to actually deal with this, so I dunno how to actually make any of my videos on a proper schedule.</p>

        <p>Another thing, if you may not have noticed, is that I am adding various psychological elements to the videos. I have felt
          like it would be an amazing idea to do ever since I made the MyPal on Windows 98 video, however I have only managed to do it
          for the first time in Windows 3.0 build 33 video. Surprisingly, I really have no proper structure for the plot.
          It's honestly confusing where to go with the videos. I have so many interesting ideas that I could try out for the story,
          however I don't know what is the best choice for the story.</p>
        
        <p>If you are interested in the story, however I have some stuff that remain consistent across my ideas for the videos.
		   Most of secondary characters will remain clones, RayZen is self-isolated, and there will be an end to the videos. The main
           topics will also be technology, depression, loneliness and gender dysphoria.</p>
        
        <p>However, I have good news for you all - I am actually working on a new video! It will be about Windows Nashville and
           Windows Memphis. I have only begun working on the video, however you can expect a new video releasing soon. It will
           have some stuff to do with the lore as other videos do. I will also expand the ARG that Windows XP RTM video included.
           Hopefully I will be able to include more of the lore in future videos.</p>
           
        <p>See you when my new video gets finished!</p>
