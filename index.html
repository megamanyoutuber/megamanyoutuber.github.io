Welp. from a <a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/microsoft-edge-protocol-competition.html">page</a> that was shared by someone in one of Discord servers I use, looks like Microsoft is into forcing their web browser yet again. Good question is, Why??? I don't want Microsoft Edge at all, why can't Microsoft just let me use Firefox? Thanks god I'm on Windows 7 instead of Windows 11 Nickel. After seeing this being done by Microsoft, looks like I'll never ever install Windows 11 Nickel.<br>

Decided to update the design of this website to be something much more interesting, instead of plain old white background and black text.<br>

Windows 11 released? You mean it's 1 year anniversary of <a href="http://razorback95.com">Razorback</a>? Honestly I never understood the point of why people would support such a disaster called Windows 11, there are plenty of issues with it. UI based on electron, unstable, <b>retarded</b> system requirements. No. Don't even try to convince me those requirements are good, Microsoft has to understand that they will never make Windows <b>EVER</b> secure.<br>
Oh, also sorry for not updating this website in a while.
