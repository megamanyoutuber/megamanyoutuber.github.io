Windows 11 released? You mean it's 1 year anniversary of <a href="http://razorback95.com">Razorback</a>? Honestly I never understood the point of why people would support such a disaster called Windows 11, there are plenty of issues with it. UI based on electron, unstable, <b>retarded</b> system requirements. No. Don't even try to convince me those requirements are good, Microsoft has to understand that they will never make Windows <b>EVER</b> secure.<br>
Oh, also sorry for not updating this website in a while.
